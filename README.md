# Unmock Katacoda Tutorial

The accompanying code for our [Katacoda Scenarios](https://github.com/unmock/katacoda-scenarios/).

## Description

When combined, the Katacoda Tutorial and Scenarios are designed to provide a gentle introduction to integration testing with Unmock. This introduction is featured on the [Unmock homepage](https://www.unmock.io/), as well as on [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/unmock). 

This repository houses the example tests, as well as the API spec and function being tested. All of the written documentation associated with these tests is located in a [different repository](https://github.com/unmock/katacoda-scenarios).
